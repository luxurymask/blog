<h1>Liuxl's Blog</h1>
<p>This is a blog from liuxl and it is build on the github website.</p>
<h2>My first blog here?</h2>
<p>This is not a tec blog, ironically. I think maybe it is because of my poor technical foundation.</p>
<p>Today I solved 3 leetcode problems, but none of those solutions is brilliant.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I need to finish the 113 and to start the netease music crawler.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I really need to start pushing the recommendation stuff forward.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>4.29</h2>
<p>113 get.</p>
<p>Having no time for the recommendation, tomorrow we'll focus on that.</p>
<p>And the KMP .etc, there's really too much to learn.</p>
